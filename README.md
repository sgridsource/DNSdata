# DNSdata module

This module can generate binary neutron star initial data, where the stars
can be on any orbits, and each star can have arbitrary masses and spins.
If you need low eccentricity orbits, please checkout the README in
[https://github.com/sgridsource/EccRed](https://github.com/sgridsource/EccRed).

For DNSdata to work we also need the module
[https://github.com/sgridsource/EoS_T0](EoS_T0),
as well as the libraries mentioned on 
[https://www.physics.fau.edu/~wolf/Research/FAU-sgrid](https://www.physics.fau.edu/~wolf/Research/FAU-sgrid)


# Example parameter files:

* There are some examples in the dir ParFiles.
  See [ParFiles/Note.txt](ParFiles/Note.txt) for more details.
