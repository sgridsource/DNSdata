completed:
---
is in a state that can compile


broken:
--
-the qmax finder alo9ng the x-axis
-maybe also set_DNSdata_actual_xyzmax_pars
-we need to ensure that sigma1 is that at lam=1 where 2 SSURF boxes touch


started to change:
---
sgrid_DNSdata.c
DNSgrid.c
DNSdata.c
DNS_CTS.m
set_DNSdata_Sigma_BCs.m
DNS_compute_new_q_atXYZ.m
DNS_compute_new_q.m
DNS_set_dlnIntegEuler.m


still need changing:
---
all else




check:
---
in DNS_CTS.m , ...
  OmegaCrossR1 == - Omega y,
  OmegaCrossR2 == + Omega (x-xC),
  OmegaCrossR3 == 0,
  should center be off the x-axis???
